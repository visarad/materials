                                   Ansible orchestration engine 


Control node:

    Any machine with ansible isntalled is a control node. 
    we can run ansible commands and playbooks from the control nodes.
    We can not use windows as control node.
    we can have multiple nodes as control nodes.



Control node setup:

    It is a master node which controls the worker nodes
